How Your NeuroLens Assistant Works

1. Main Program

This is the core of everything. It runs the whole assistant, listens for voice commands, and makes sure the system works together.

2. Screen Scanner

This part can look at your screen. It takes a screenshot of what’s on your desktop and reads any text from it. So if you need to interact with something on your screen, this is the part that understands what’s there.

3. Command Memory

Your assistant remembers past commands. This means it can keep track of what you’ve asked it to do and can refer back to that information if needed. This helps the assistant make smarter decisions over time.

4. Error Handling

If something goes wrong (like the assistant not understanding you), this part steps in and handles the error. It ensures the assistant doesn’t crash and can recover gracefully. For example, if the assistant doesn't understand a command, it might ask you to repeat it.

5. Multiple Windows

The assistant supports working with multiple windows. This means it can interact with different apps or windows at the same time, like switching between your browser and an editing app. It ensures the right window is focused and that actions are done in the correct place.

6. Voice Recognition

This is the part that listens to your voice and converts it into text. When you say something like “Open Figma,” it hears you, writes down what you said, and sends it to the next step.
